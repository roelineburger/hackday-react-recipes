# The Body Lab - A Hackday React Project

Welcome to The Body Lab, a web application designed to meet the needs of Milan, a passionate personal trainer in New York City. Milan's goal is to provide her clients and followers with a centralized platform to upload, save, and share her favorite and trusted recipes. The Body Lab is here to help Milan achieve her vision of inspiring a healthy lifestyle through accessible and delicious recipes.

## Project Overview

The Body Lab is a full-stack web application built using the following technologies:

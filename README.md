# The Body Lab - hackday react project

# CLIENT
I created this website with my ideal client in mind. She is a 30 something, highly ambitous personal trainer with the name Milan, living in New York. 
Her clients are her life, and helping, promoting and inspiring people to live a healthy lifestyle is what makes her heart beat.

# SPEC
Milan wants to have a central hub where she is able to upload, save and share her favourite tried and trusted recipes with her clients, and followers.
Thus the bodylab is an application where she is able to upload, tag, and save recipes based on certain keywords.

Frontend:
.React

Backend:
.Nodejs
.Express
.MongoDB to save recipes to a database.
